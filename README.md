algo_first_proj
A beginner-friendly Python project implementing fundamental data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST) and Heap.

Overview
This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and experimenting with basic data structures. It includes implementations of:

Binary Search Tree (BST): A node-based binary tree structure where each node has a comparable key (and associated value) and satisfies the binary search property.

Heap: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property; it can be a max-heap or min-heap depending on the implementation.

The main.py script demonstrates the usage of these data structures.

Features
Insertion, deletion, and traversal operations for BST.

Heap operations including insertion and extraction.

Modular code structure for ease of understanding and maintenance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Gist

Installation
Clone the repository:
readmeTips.github.io

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Bekend/algo_first_proj.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
DEV Community

bash
Copy
Edit
cd algo_first_proj
Usage
Run the main.py script to see the data structures in action:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This will execute predefined operations demonstrating the functionality of BST and Heap.

Project Structure
BST.py: Contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree.

Heap.py: Contains the implementation of the Heap.
