# algo_first_proj

A beginner-friendly Python project implementing fundamental data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST) and Heap.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and experimenting with basic data structures. It includes implementations of:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A node-based binary tree where each node has a comparable key and satisfies the binary search property.
- **Heap**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property (max-heap implementation included).

The `main.py` script demonstrates the usage of these data structures through simple operations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Insertion, deletion, and traversal for BST.
- Insertion and extraction for Heap.
- Simple, modular code for easy readability and experimentation.
